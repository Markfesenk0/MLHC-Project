This repository contains both the project we were instructed to submit and our working notebook:
1. The folder "project" contains the provided files "__init__.py", "requirements.txt", "unseen data evaluation.py" and other files we added in order to run the pipeline. It also contains a README file documenting our newly added files, initial cohort and test example files, labs and vitals metadata files, and outputs of an execution of the pipeline.
2. The file "Notebook.ipynb" contains a lot of our work (everything that was not deleted along the way) and includes figures. Because of the figures it can't be displayed in github (or at least we couldn't), so if you want to look at it you might have to download it or open it in some other way.

As we understand the instructions, the "project" folder doesn't have to include everything we have done and the notebook doesn't have to include detailed documentation. If we are wrong, we can fix it.
