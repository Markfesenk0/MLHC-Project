# MLHC Project
In this project, we develop prediction models for 3 ICU outcomes. More specifically:

- Mortality during hospitalization or up to 30 days after discharge.
- Prolonged stay: length of stay > 7 days.
- Hospital readmission in 30 days after discharge (not to be confused with ICU readmission
within the same hospital admission).
